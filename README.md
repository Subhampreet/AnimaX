### Setup Guide
- Download the zip and extract it in any path you want.
- Open a command prompt and go to the path in which you extracted the zip.
- Enter ```bash npm install``` in the command prompt to install the required modules.
- Make sure your api project is running properly.
- Make sure your config.js is properly configured. 
- Enter ```bash npm run dev``` in the command prompt and your website is ready to run.

### API Used:
 - [Jikan API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/#section/Information)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
